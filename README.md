# `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/native-image`

The Paketo Buildpack for Native Image is a Cloud Native Buildpack that uses the [GraalVM Native Image builder][native-image] (`native-image`) to compile a standalone executable from an executable JAR.

Most users should not use this component buildpack directly and should instead use the [Paketo Java Native Image][bp/java-native-image], which provides the full set of buildpacks required to build a native image application.

## Behavior

This buildpack will participate if one the following conditions are met:

* `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE` is set.
* An upstream buildpack requests `native-image-application` in the build plan.
* An upstream buildpack provides `native-image-argfile` in the build plan.

The buildpack will do the following:

* Requests that the Native Image builder be installed by requiring `native-image-builder` in the build plan.
* If `$BP_BINARY_COMPRESSION_METHOD` is set to `upx`, requests that UPX be installed by requiring `upx` in the buildplan.
* Uses `native-image` a to build a GraalVM native image and removes existing bytecode. Defaults to building the `/workspace` as an exploded JAR. If `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILT_ARTIFACT` is set, it will build from the specified JAR file.
* Uses `$BP_BINARY_COMPRESSION_METHOD` if set to `upx` or `gzexe` to compress the native image.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE`                      | Whether to build a native image from the application.  Defaults to false.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGUMENTS`      | Arguments to pass to directly to the `native-image` command. These arguments must be valid and correctly formed or the `native-image` command will fail.                                                                                      |
| `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGUMENTS_FILE` | A file containing arguments to pass to directly to the `native-image` command. The file must exist and the contents must be valid and correctly formed or the `native-image` command will fail. The file must follow the `@argument` file format as [specified by Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/javac.html#BHCJEIBB). An argument file can be space-separated, EOL-separated, or a mix of both. We suggest sticking with one or the other, mixed separator support is best-effort only. |
| `$BP_BINARY_COMPRESSION_METHOD`         | Compression mechanism used to reduce binary size. Options: `none` (default), `upx` or `gzexe`                                                                                                                                                 |
| `$BP_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILT_ARTIFACT`       | Configure the built application artifact explicitly. This is required if building a native image from a JAR file                                                                                                                              |

### Compression Caveats

1. Using `gzexe` if you intend to run your application on a Paketo Tiny image is not currently supported. The `gzexe` utility will compress your executable into what is a shell script, which executes and extracts the actual binary to a temp location. This process requires `/bin/sh` and that is not in the Tiny images. If you try using `gzexe` with a Tiny stack, it'll build OK but fail to run saying a file is missing.

2. Using `upx` will create a compressed executable that fails to run on M1 Macs. There is at the time of writing a bug in the emulation layer used by Docker on M1 Macs that is triggered when you try to run amd64 executable that has been compressed using `upx`. This is a known issue and will hopefully be patched in a future release.
